It's Okay"
Sun is up should be feeling great,
Your feeling rough got too much on your plate,
A busy day got a lot to do,
A heavy head you think you've caught the flu.
Something deep inside begins to stir,
Spirit, conscience your not really sure.
It's gonna be okay...
It's gonna be okay...
Another day your late for work,
The shower's cold you ain't got no clean shirt.
A cup of tea just might do the trick,
The milk's gone off by now feeling sick.
Something deep inside begins to stir,
Spirit, conscience your not really sure.
It's gonna be okay...
It's gonna be okay...
We laughed, we cried,
We shared along the way,
We did some things we knew we shouldn't do.
So after all what's this life living for,
Work it out or head straight for the door
It's gonna be okay...
Either way
It's gonna be okay...
You close your eyes, try to sleep.
Scold yourself for hours that you keep.
Drifting off will I dream tonight?
In my dreams perhaps I'll get it right.
Something deep inside begins to purrr,
Spirit, conscience your not really sure.
It's gonna be okay...
It's gonna be okay...
Either way
It's gonna be okay...
