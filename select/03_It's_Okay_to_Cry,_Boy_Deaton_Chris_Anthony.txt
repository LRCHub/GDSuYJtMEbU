The smell of your skin lingers on me now
You're probably on your flight back to your home town
I need some shelter of my own protection, baby
To be with myself and center
Clarity, peace, serenity
I hope you know
I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big boy now
It's okay to cry
It's okay to cry
It's okay to cry
The smell of your skin lingers on me now
You're probably on your flight back to your home town
I need some shelter of my own protection, baby
To be with myself and center
Clarity, peace, serenity
I hope you know
I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
I've got some straightenin' out to do
You know
Nobodies perfect
It's okay
It's okay to not be perfect
Your imperfections are what make you perfect, to me Well, I guess this it
I gotta go
It's time to go
I'll be back
And when I'm back
I'll be stronger
More smart
Be taller
Better looking
Maybe I'll have found the love of my life
I know you're out there
I just gotta figure out how to use this phone
Seems like I can be whoever I want to be, on my phone You know, I can be seven and half feet tall
I can be rich
I can be the happiest person on the Earth
I can know everybody in the World
I can know everything in the World
I can be everything
But, what about when I lose my phone?
And I'm not that person anymore
Who am I?
Am I someone I would fall in love with?
Well, I'm gonna go found out
I'm gonna go find out who I am
This is Deaton Chris Anthony
Gotta go now
Cya later
Bye
Wait!
I'm so sorry!
I didn't mean to!
