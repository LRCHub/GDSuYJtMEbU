[Hook]
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay (to be happy now)
Tell me it's okay (because I'm happy now)
Tell me it's okay
[Verse 1]
Hey
I think I might move on to something new
But only if you say that's cool with you
Cause I love all the little things you do (I mean did)
Cause
I begged you to show up
And; I asked you to stay
You told me to grow up
So I pushed you away
I tell you""you know what""
And; we fought once again
Then we got back together
Who's kidding who, it's a trend
Because
I like being alone
But i don't like being lonely
I like being home
But I don't like being homies
You know I'm so sorry
For making you feel like you lost me
We're two unstable enablers
Please try not to be salty
Because
All this time & all these tries
Leave questions open ended
& I would rather die
Than try to live with this resentment
So we could try just one more time
To make sure that we meant it
Or we could cut our losses
Before we blow up & dead it
So
